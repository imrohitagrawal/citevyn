2. Contextual chunks.
3. Exact term lookup.
4. Sessions and messages.
5. Retrieval evidence.
6. Answer cache.
7. Evaluation runs.
8. Audit events.
9. Index versioning.
10. Per-call provider cost metering.

## 15. provider_calls

Stores one row per paid provider call. This is the metering substrate the
`RELEASE_PLAN.md` section 9 daily budget (soft $5 / hard $10) is computed from:
token counts on `LLMResult` are discarded once an answer is returned, so spend has
no other record.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| call_id | UUID | Primary key |
| occurred_at | timestamp | Call completion time; the daily budget buckets on this |
| kind | text | llm, embedding |
| call_site | text | answer, condense, alias_intent, ingest, eval, unknown |
| provider | text | Provider name |
| model | text | Model identifier |
| input_tokens | integer | Prompt tokens |
| output_tokens | integer | Completion tokens |
| attempts | integer | Provider HTTP requests issued, including retries (>= 1) |
| cost_usd | numeric(14,6) | Stored cost, never recomputed |
| input_price_per_1m | numeric(12,6) | Rate applied; NULL exactly when `priced` is false |
| output_price_per_1m | numeric(12,6) | Rate applied; NULL exactly when `priced` is false |
| priced | boolean | False means the price book had no entry |
| tokens_estimated | boolean | True means token counts are a local estimate |
| request_id | text | Correlation id; nullable (ingest and eval run outside a request) |

Design decisions:

1. `cost_usd` is stored, not derived. Prices are snapshots, so recomputing from
   today's price book would silently rewrite yesterday's spend when a provider
   changes its rates. The rates applied are stored alongside for audit.
2. `priced = false` means the price book had no entry for `(provider, model)`, so
   `cost_usd` is 0 and the budget is **under-counting** that call. It is a signal
   to add a price, not a free call.
3. `attempts` counts provider HTTP requests including retries, so a flaky provider
   can cost several times a naive per-call count.
4. No prompt or answer text is stored — only counts and identifiers — so the table
   cannot become a second copy of user questions in a log or backup.

Numeric, not float: these values are summed across thousands of rows and compared
against a dollar threshold, and 6 decimal places resolve a single cheap call.

## 16. Indexing Recommendations

1. Index `documents.source_name`.
2. Index `documents.product_area`.
3. Index `chunks.product_area`.
4. Full-text index `chunks.chunk_text`.
5. Vector index embeddings.
6. Unique index on `exact_terms.term_text + product_area + chunk_id`.
7. Index `answer_cache.cache_key`.
8. Index `messages.session_id`.
9. Index `retrieved_evidence.message_id`.
10. Index `provider_calls.occurred_at` (the budget's hot "spend since midnight UTC" query).
