"""Async Redis client builder.

Centralizes how the rate limiter (and any future component) opens a
``redis.asyncio.Redis`` client so the connection pool, timeouts, and
``decode_responses`` flag are configured in one place.

The builder is lazy: nothing connects at import time. The first caller
of :func:`get_redis_client` pays the connection cost; subsequent
callers share the same :class:`redis.asyncio.Redis` instance **as
long as the URL is the same**. If the URL rotates (operator changes
``CITEVYN_REDIS_URL`` at runtime, or a test swaps in a different
client), the singleton is rebuilt and the previous pool is closed
before the new one is opened. This is the standard "honour the
parameter" pattern — a half-singleton that silently pins the first
URL forever is a production footgun (operator rotates the password,
limiter still hits the old host, no log line explains the gap).

For tests, :func:`reset_redis_client` drops the singleton so the next
caller rebuilds it. Hermetic tests use :mod:`fakeredis.aioredis`
instead — see ``backend/tests/test_redis_rate_limit.py``.
