"""CORS configuration for the FastAPI app.

The MVP allows only the approved frontend origin
(``docs/SECURITY_MODEL.md §11``); the allowlist is sourced from
:class:`Settings.cors_allowed_origins` and must be overridden in
production. Wildcards are explicitly forbidden: a wildcard would let
any origin read the response, which is a cross-origin data-leak risk
for a demo that returns assistant answers and citations.

The helper is intentionally a function (not a module-level singleton)
so tests can call :func:`configure_cors` with their own
:class:`Settings` and so the wiring is one line in :func:`create_app`.
