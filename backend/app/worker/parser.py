"""Parse raw source text into a :class:`ParsedDocument`.

The MVP supports Markdown only. The parser is intentionally
naive — no CommonMark, no HTML, no front-matter. The MVP
fixtures are flat markdown and the production source feed
will pre-render to the same shape.

A :class:`ParsedDocument` is a title (the first ``#``
heading) followed by a list of :class:`Block` records, one
per ``##`` section. The chunker downstream groups blocks
by ``## `` heading; the title is preserved separately so the
chunker can prepend it to each chunk (the "contextual" in
"contextual chunking").
