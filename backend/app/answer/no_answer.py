"""No-answer fallback.

Single source of truth for the response shape when the orchestrator
cannot produce a grounded answer. The orchestrator short-circuits to
:func:`build_no_answer_response` whenever:

* the intent is ``unsupported`` (the guardrail refused the question),
* the intent is ``no_answer`` (the router never produces this from
  text; it is set by the orchestrator when retrieval yields zero
  evidence),
* the retrieval layer returns an empty evidence list,
* the LLM emits the no-answer refusal,
* the citation validator rejects the LLM's output.

The shape matches the orchestrator's response contract
(``docs/API_SPEC.md`` §5) but is built without touching the
database so it stays cheap to call on the hot path.
